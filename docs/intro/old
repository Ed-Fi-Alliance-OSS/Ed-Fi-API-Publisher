### Configure Local Sandbox Environment

Before using the API Publisher on a target ODS, you must create and configure an API client with the appropriate permissions for publishing.  The source and destination ODS/API must be of the same version.

For Ed-Fi ODS / API 5.1 through 5.3 only: create and assign a claim set for the API Publisher by running the following database scripts:
  * [Create-API-Publisher-Writer-Security-Metadata.sql](eng/Create-API-Publisher-Writer-Security-Metadata.sql)
  * [Configure-Minimal-Sandbox-Client-as-API-Publisher-Writer.sql](eng/Configure-Minimal-Sandbox-Client-as-API-Publisher-Writer.sql)
